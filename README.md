<h1>Project Serendipity</h1>

<h2> Concept </h2>
Project serendipity was created as a staple project, so that the employer can access my current level of programming skills and techniques. 
As a website, it consists of a platform that users can share their experiences with other users all over the world when it comes to a specific business type (hospitality, holidays, etc.).  When it comes to targeted locations associated with a specific business type, the content tends to be trendy, alternative or low cost. This creates the feeling of novelty and identity with the website’s image.
The concept derives from the word “Serendipity” which means: “An aptitude for making desirable discoveries by accident” according to dictionary.com. Taking in consideration what was stated in the previous paragraph, the idea is to encourage the user to search the website for its alternative content in order to find that “desirable discovery by accident” hence the name for it.
